## Installation

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, please ensure that you add the following lines to your ansible.cfg file.

```ini
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/

```

## Use cases

Once installed, you can reference the cloud.aws_troubleshooting collection content by its fully qualified collection name (FQCN), for example:

```yaml
  # Troubleshoot when ec2 instance cannot connect to rds instance
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
       - name: Validate that role is also failing
         block:
           - name: Include role cloud.aws_troubleshooting.troubleshoot_rds_connectivity
             ansible.builtin.include_role:
               name: cloud.aws_troubleshooting.troubleshoot_rds_connectivity
             vars:
               troubleshoot_rds_connectivity_db_instance_id: "{{ rds_identifier }}"
               troubleshoot_rds_connectivity_ec2_instance_id: "{{ ec2_instance_id }}"
         rescue:
           - name: Set role failure info
             ansible.builtin.set_fact:
               role_failure_action: "{{ ansible_failed_task.action }}"
               role_failure_msg: "{{ ansible_failed_result.msg }}"

  # Troubleshoot AWS resource connectivity
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
       - name: Include 'cloud.aws_troubleshooting.connectivity_troubleshooter' role
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: cloud.aws_troubleshooting.connectivity_troubleshooter
        vars:
          connectivity_troubleshooter_destination_ip: "{{ ip_instance_2 }}"

  aws configure set aws_access_key_id     my-access-key
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key my-secret-key
  aws configure set region                eu-north-1

  ansible-test integration [target]
```
